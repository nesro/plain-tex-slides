I wanted to look just a little tiny bit under the hood of the almighty {La,Xe,Lua,}TeX, the masterpiece of Donald Ervin Knuth. I created this in something like a trial-and-error procedure, so the result is not the best-practice in any way. Not only that this isn't the best-practice, this is really bad. I'm sorry for that.
